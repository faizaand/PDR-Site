# Official Website of the Pun Democratic Republic
Greetings! This repository contains the openly available source code for the official website of the Pun Democratic Republic. The site is used to get information about the PDR's stances on the issues, register for and access citizenship services, and most importantly, for me to practice my skills with React.

To run, simply clone the repository and run `npm run dev` to get the React server running. It should open a preview on `localhost:3000`.
